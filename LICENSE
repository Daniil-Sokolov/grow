There is currently no official license for this project other than what you are reading in this file. We're still figuring the specific details out.

This repository will be updated with a stanard, permissive license when more of the engineering work on Grow is completed and we have time to figure out the best license to use for the project.

At this very moment in its early stages, you are free to use and develop PyGrow for personal, non-commercial use and contributions are welcome. As mentioned, a permissive license will come soon that will cover additional use cases.
